Transfer Pricing applications cash flow methodologies reference NEG_AMRT_LIMIT to determine if the NEG_AMRT_AMT is exceeding its defined limits, if the negative amortization limit is exceeded, the engine recalculates current payment, cur_payment.\n\nWhile calculating a payment event, payment date, if the cash flow engine calculates negative principal runoff, the cash flow engine also checks the negative amortization limit, NEG_AMRT_LIMIT, in order to ensure that the current NEG_AMRT_AMT is not exceeding its limit. NEG_AMRT_LIMIT is defined as a percentage of the original principal balance. For example, NEG_AMRT_LIMIT = 25 means that the negative amortization amount should never exceed 25 percent of the original principal balance, principal balance should never exceed 125 percent of the original balance. The formula for this check is:\n, 1 * calculated, negative, principal runoff + negative amortization balance > NEG_AMRT_LIMIT divided by 100 * ORG_PAR_BAL,\nIf NEG_AMRT_AMT is exceeding this limit, the cash flow engine recalculates the payment amount in order to fully amortize the instrument.\nWhen deriving the recalculated payment amount after exceeding the NEG_AMRT_LIMIT, the cash flow engine also applies payment decrease or increase limits per period, PMT_DECR_CYCLE, PMT_INCR_CYCLE, and payment decrease or increase limits for the life of the record, PMT_DECR_LIFE,\nPMT_INCR_LIFE. Because these fields limit how much the CUR_PAYMENT can be changed, it is possible that the record continues to negatively amortize even after\na NEG_AMRT_LIMIT has been exceeded. If negative amortization does continue, the NEG_AMRT_AMT continues to grow.\nRefers to the maximum loan balance permitted under the negative amortization for the loan.

The total debt to income, or back end, ratio, shows how much of your gross income would go toward all of your debt obligations, including mortgage, car loans, child support and alimony, credit card bills, student loans and condominium fees. In general, your total monthly debt obligation should not exceed 36 percent of your gross income. To calculate your debt to income ratio, multiply your annual salary by 0.36, then divide by 12, months. The answer is your maximum allowable debt to income ratio Example: Furthermore, the lender says the total debt payments each month should not exceed 36 percent, which comes to USD 1,200., USD 40,000 times 0.36 equals 14,400, and 14,400 divided by 12 months equals 1,200.",

As a general guideline, your monthly mortgage payment, including principal, interest, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance, should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income. To calculate your housing expense ratio, multiply your annual salary by 0.28, then divide by 12, months. The answer is your maximum housing expense ratio.
