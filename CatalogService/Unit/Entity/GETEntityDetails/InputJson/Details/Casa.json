Original gross book balance is the sum total of End of Period Balance Plus Deferred Balance, represented as a negative amount to depict the unamortized portion. This is used while calculating amortization. The book balance is the term financial institutions use to describe the amount of money available before any adjustments have been made for deposits in transit, checks that have not yet been cleared, reserve requirements and interest received from 'float funds' hence is generally greater than end of period balance, Also called as 'gross balance'.\nIt also excludes any deferred balance that is unamortized.",
