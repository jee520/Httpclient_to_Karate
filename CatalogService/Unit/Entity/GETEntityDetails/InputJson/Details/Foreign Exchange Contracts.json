Institutions such as banks will determine their credit losses through an analysis of the actual loan defaults. While quantifying some losses may be simple, in some situations it may be quite difficult and require the analysis of multiple variables. For example, if Bank X loans USD 1 million to ABC Company and ABC defaults on the note, Bank Xs loss is not necessarily USD 1 million. This is because Bank X may hold substantial assets as collateral, and or may use the courts in an effort to be made whole. When all of these variables are factored in, Bank X may have lost substantially less than the original USD 1 million loan. The process of analyzing all of these variables, as well as all of the other loans in Bank Xs portfolio, is paramount to determining the loss given default. This value is calculated by the system.",
