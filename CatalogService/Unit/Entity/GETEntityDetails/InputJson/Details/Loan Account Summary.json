The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.\nCensus tracts are identified by an up to four digit integer number and may have an optional two digit suffix, for example 1457.02 or 23. The census tract codes consist of six digits with an implied decimal between the fourth and fifth digit corresponding to the basic census tract number but with leading zeroes and trailing zeroes for census tracts without a suffix. The tract number examples above would have codes of 145702 and 002300, respectively.",

This method is applied on the financial assets for which cash flows can be generated, which includes loans and Held to Maturity, HTM, securities. In addition, assets for which cash flows are projected using behavior assumptions can also be included. The provision matrix method mainly involves the usage of direct provision rates instead of cash flow projection. This is applied on the financial assets mapped to Provision Matrix based methods. There is no constraint to the application of this method. This method is common for both impaired and non impaired exposures. The recovery rate method is applicable for impaired assets. Collateral Value Based, CVB, Method is used to calculate allowance for Mortgage products or other retail products only. In the Collateral Value Based Method, shortfall between the collateral value and carrying amount, with expected recovery cost, of an exposure is calculated. Allowance is calculated based on shortfall amount subject to shortfall threshold.",
