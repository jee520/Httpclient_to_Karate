NEG_AMRT_LIMIT is defined as a percentage of the original principal balance. For example, NEG_AMRT_LIMIT = 25 means that the negative amortization amount should never exceed 25 percent of the original principal balance, principal balance should never exceed 125 percent of the original balance. The formula for this check is:\n, 1 * calculated, negative, principal runoff + negative amortization balance > NEG_AMRT_LIMIT divided by 100 * ORG_PAR_BAL,\nIf NEG_AMRT_AMT is exceeding this limit, the cash flow engine recalculates the payment amount in order to fully amortize the instrument.\nWhen deriving the recalculated payment amount after exceeding the NEG_AMRT_LIMIT, the cash flow engine also applies payment decrease or increase limits per period, PMT_DECR_CYCLE, PMT_INCR_CYCLE, and payment decrease or increase limits for the life of the record, PMT_DECR_LIFE,\nPMT_INCR_LIFE.

While the specific details of overdraft protection programs vary from institution to institution, and also vary over time, those currently offered by institutions incorporate some or all of the following characteristics:\n  Institutions inform consumers that overdraft protection is a feature of their accounts and promote the use of the service. Institutions also may inform consumers of their aggregate dollar limit under the overdraft protection program.\n  Coverage is automatic for consumers who meet the criteria of the institution, e.g., account has been open a certain number of days, deposits are made regularly. Typically, the institution performs no credit underwriting. Overdrafts generally are paid up to the aggregate limit set by the institution for the specific class of accounts, typically USD 100 to 500.\n  Many program disclosures state that payment of an overdraft is discretionary on the part of the institution, and may disclaim any legal obligation of the institution to pay any overdraft.\n  The service may extend to check transactions as well as other transactions, such as withdrawals at automated teller machines, ATMs, transactions using debit cards, pre authorized automatic debits from an account of the consumer, telephone initiated funds transfers, and on line banking transactions. A flat fee is charged each time the service is triggered and an overdraft item is paid. Commonly, a fee in the same amount would be charged even if the overdraft item was not paid. A daily fee also may apply for each day the account remains overdrawn.\n  Some institutions offer closed end loans to consumers who do not bring their accounts to a positive balance within a specified time period.
