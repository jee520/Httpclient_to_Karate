Expected values are Non Maturity, Non Performing And Devolvement, Recovery, Volatile, Core and Non Core. \nThe payment and repricing characteristics can be gathered for most financial instruments, but for some the contractual cashflows may be absent or may be based on occurrence of certain events. Asset Liability Management allows you to define custom behavior, payment and repricing patterns to accurately model the unique characteristics for such instruments. Behavior pattern can be defined for the following types of instruments \nNon maturity Instruments,\nNon Performing Instruments,\nDevolvement and Recovery of Guarantees.\n\nOnce you create a behavior pattern, you can use it by mapping the unique behavior pattern code as the amortization type code for your instruments. Behavior pattern codes are defined within a pre set range, 70000 – 99999. When the cash flow engine encounters an instrument with an amortization type code within this pre determined range, it understands that a Behavior Pattern should be referenced for determining the principal cash flow amounts. Non performing Asset need not have a sub type associated, all the events i.e. substandard, doubtful or loss is processed. No interest cashflow will be generated and any balance on the maturity date would be written off. In the case of non maturity instruments the core and volatile runoff events are run. Interest cashflow is paid out on the payment dates. The engine assumes the maturity of the longest non maturing instrument as the maturity date.",

Cash flow transfer pricing methodologies for fixed rate records use original payment amount as the payment amount for amortization purposes. For a fixed rate record, the cash flow engine rolls forward from the origination date by payment frequency when defining payment dates up to the maturity date of the record. From origination, the cash flow engine amortizes the original balance by the original payment amount. The precise method of this amortization depends on the amortization type code. Original payment amount is also used if the User Defined Payment Pattern payment method percent Original Payment is designated.",

These marketed programs typically provide consumers with an express overdraft limit that applies to their accounts. While the specific details of overdraft protection programs vary from institution to institution, and also vary over time, those currently offered by institutions incorporate some or all of the following characteristics:\n  Institutions inform consumers that overdraft protection is a feature of their accounts and promote the use of the service. Institutions also may inform consumers of their aggregate dollar limit under the overdraft protection program.\n  Coverage is automatic for consumers who meet the criteria of the institution, e.g., account has been open a certain number of days, deposits are made regularly. Typically, the institution performs no credit underwriting. Overdrafts generally are paid up to the aggregate limit set by the institution for the specific class of accounts, typically USD 100 to 500.\n  Many program disclosures state that payment of an overdraft is discretionary on the part of the institution, and may disclaim any legal obligation of the institution to pay any overdraft.\n  The service may extend to check transactions as well as other transactions, such as withdrawals at automated teller machines, ATMs, transactions using debit cards, pre authorized automatic debits from an account of the consumer, telephone initiated funds transfers, and on line banking transactions. A flat fee is charged each time the service is triggered and an overdraft item is paid. Commonly, a fee in the same amount would be charged even if the overdraft item was not paid. A daily fee also may apply for each day the account remains overdrawn.\n  Some institutions offer closed end loans to consumers who do not bring their accounts to a positive balance within a specified time period. These repayment plans allow consumers to repay their overdrafts and fees in installments. List of values are Y and N.",
