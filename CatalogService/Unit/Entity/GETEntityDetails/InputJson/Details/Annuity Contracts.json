These are called pension or retirement annuities. The main difference between voluntary and compulsory purchase annuities is voluntary purchase annuities are bought with personal savings, not pension scheme savings, or a capital lump sum, there are also tax differences. The capital lump sum used to buy a voluntary annuity can be the 25 percent tax free cash lump sum you are allowed to take from your pension fund. Voluntary purchase annuities can offer an alternative to putting your savings into a bank or building society. Putting your savings into a bank account means you can earn interest and you get your full savings amount back from the Bank when you die or close the account. However, the amount of interest earned is affected by rising and falling interest rates.",
