The discount amount is the difference between the loans current market price and its stated par value.

As per www.finra.org, A right of accumulation, ROA, allows investors to aggregate their own holdings as well as the holdings of certain related parties, such as spouses and children, toward achieving the investment thresholds at which breakpoint discounts become available. An investor may sign a Letter of Intent, LOI, which allows the investor to receive breakpoint discounts based upon a commitment to buy a specified number of mutual fund shares over a period of time, usually 13 months. For example, an investor who plans to buy USD 25,000 worth of shares in a particular mutual fund over the course of a year, but in 5 increments of USD 5,000 could sign a letter of intent pursuant to which the investor could obtain the breakpoint discount available on purchases of USD 25,000 on each USD 5,000 purchase. Thus, signing an LOI allows the investor to take advantage of discount that would not otherwise be available.",
