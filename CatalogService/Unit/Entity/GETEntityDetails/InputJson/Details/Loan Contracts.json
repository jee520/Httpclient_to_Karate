Asset Liability Management allows you to define custom behavior, payment and repricing patterns to accurately model the unique characteristics for such instruments. Behavior pattern can be defined for the following types of instruments \nNon maturity Instruments,\nNon Performing Instruments,\nDevolvement and Recovery of Guarantees.\n\nOnce you create a behavior pattern, you can use it by mapping the unique behavior pattern code as the amortization type code for your instruments. Behavior pattern codes are defined within a pre set range, 70000 – 99999. When the cash flow engine encounters an instrument with an amortization type code within this pre determined range, it understands that a Behavior Pattern should be referenced for determining the principal cash flow amounts. Non performing Asset need not have a sub type associated, all the events i.e. substandard, doubtful or loss is processed. No interest cashflow will be generated and any balance on the maturity date would be written off. In the case of non maturity instruments the core and volatile runoff events are run. Interest cashflow is paid out on the payment dates. The engine assumes the maturity of the longest non maturing instrument as the maturity date.",

NEG_AMRT_LIMIT is defined as a percentage of the original principal balance. For example, NEG_AMRT_LIMIT = 25 means that the negative amortization amount should never exceed 25 percent of the original principal balance, principal balance should never exceed 125 percent of the original balance. The formula for this check is:\n, 1 * calculated, negative, principal runoff + negative amortization balance > NEG_AMRT_LIMIT divided by 100 * ORG_PAR_BAL,\nIf NEG_AMRT_AMT is exceeding this limit, the cash flow engine recalculates the payment amount in order to fully amortize the instrument.\nWhen deriving the recalculated payment amount after exceeding the NEG_AMRT_LIMIT, the cash flow engine also applies payment decrease or increase limits per period, PMT_DECR_CYCLE, PMT_INCR_CYCLE, and payment decrease or increase limits for the life of the record, PMT_DECR_LIFE,\nPMT_INCR_LIFE.

As a general guideline, your monthly mortgage payment, including principal, interest, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance, should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income.

Add on is an amount for potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract calculated by applying an add on factor to the notional principal amount of the derivative.
