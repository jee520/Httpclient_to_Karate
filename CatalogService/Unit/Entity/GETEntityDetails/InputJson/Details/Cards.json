NEG_AMRT_LIMIT is defined as a percentage of the original principal balance. For example, NEG_AMRT_LIMIT = 25 means that the negative amortization amount should never exceed 25 percent of the original principal balance, principal balance should never exceed 125 percent of the original balance. The formula for this check is:\n, 1 * calculated, negative, principal runoff + negative amortization balance > NEG_AMRT_LIMIT divided by 100 * ORG_PAR_BAL,\nIf NEG_AMRT_AMT is exceeding this limit, the cash flow engine recalculates the payment amount in order to fully amortize the instrument.\nWhen deriving the recalculated payment amount after exceeding the NEG_AMRT_LIMIT, the cash flow engine also applies payment decrease or increase limits per period, PMT_DECR_CYCLE, PMT_INCR_CYCLE, and payment decrease or increase limits for the life of the record, PMT_DECR_LIFE,\nPMT_INCR_LIFE.
