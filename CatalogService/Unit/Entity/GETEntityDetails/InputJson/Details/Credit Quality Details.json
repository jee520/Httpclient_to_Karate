Expected values are Non Maturity, Non Performing And Devolvement, Recovery, Volatile, Core and Non Core. \nThe payment and repricing characteristics can be gathered for most financial instruments, but for some the contractual cashflows may be absent or may be based on occurrence of certain events. Asset Liability Management allows you to define custom behavior, payment and repricing patterns to accurately model the unique characteristics for such instruments. Behavior pattern can be defined for the following types of instruments \nNon maturity Instruments,\nNon Performing Instruments,\nDevolvement and Recovery of Guarantees.\n\nOnce you create a behavior pattern, you can use it by mapping the unique behavior pattern code as the amortization type code for your instruments. Behavior pattern codes are defined within a pre set range, 70000 â€“ 99999. When the cash flow engine encounters an instrument with an amortization type code within this pre determined range, it understands that a Behavior Pattern should be referenced for determining the principal cash flow amounts. Non performing Asset need not have a sub type associated, all the events i.e. substandard, doubtful or loss is processed. No interest cashflow will be generated and any balance on the maturity date would be written off. In the case of non maturity instruments the core and volatile runoff events are run. Interest cashflow is paid out on the payment dates. The engine assumes the maturity of the longest non maturing instrument as the maturity date.",
