The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.\nCensus tracts are identified by an up to four digit integer number and may have an optional two digit suffix, for example 1457.02 or 23. The census tract codes consist of six digits with an implied decimal between the fourth and fifth digit corresponding to the basic census tract number but with leading zeroes and trailing zeroes for census tracts without a suffix. The tract number examples above would have codes of 145702 and 002300, respectively.",
