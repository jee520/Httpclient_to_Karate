This entity will cover all the annuity contract held by the financial institution of their customers. Annuity is used as post retirement tool, where the customer makes series of investment payment to the annuity up to a certain period to create a corpus; the annuity then makes a series of payments to the customer of the annuity, which can be either monthly, quarterly, semi annually or yearly. An immediate annuity is where the customer has a lump sum cash, which he would like to annuitize, however deferred annuity accumulates fund over a period of time before making annuity payments to the customer. The amount thus invested accumulates interest on a compound basis before making annuity payments. They charge commission for administrative expense and surrender charges should the customer abruptly close the annuity. Fixed rate annuities do not provide any options on the assets that the funds can be invested in, whereas the variable rate annuity provides the option to invest in different assets. Retirement contracts which covers accumulation as well as payment, contract should be stored in this entity. When policyholder holds retirement contracts only in accumulation period and purchases annuity contract separately on date of retirement, a new annuity contract is expected to be opened in Stage Annuity contract entity.",

This entity captures Federal or Central bank Funds, Fixed Rate and floating rate Bonds, Zero Coupon Bonds and STRIPS.\nExcess reserves that commercial banks deposit at regional Federal Reserve banks. Federal funds can then be lent to other commercial banks with insufficient reserves. These loans are made at a relatively low interest rate, called the federal funds rate or overnight rate, and they typically have an extremely short duration: overnight. Federal funds help commercial banks meet their daily reserve requirements. Banks are required to maintain a certain level of reserves based on the amount of customer deposits they are responsible for.\nFixed rate bond is a bond that pays the same amount of interest for its entire term. The benefit of owning a fixed-rate bond is that investors know with certainty how much interest they will earn and for how long. As long as the bond issuer does not default, the bondholder can predict exactly what his return on investment will be.\nFloating rate note is a debt instrument with a variable interest rate. Also known as a floater or FRN, an interest rate of the floating rate note is tied to a benchmark such as the U.S. Treasury bill rate, LIBOR, the fed funds or the prime rate. Floaters are mainly issued by financial institutions and governments, and they typically have a two- to five-year term to maturity.\nZero coupon bond is a debt security that does not pay interest (a coupon) but is traded at a deep discount, rendering profit at maturity when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.\nSTRIPS is defined as the process of removing coupons from a bond and then selling the separate parts as a zero coupon bond and interest paying coupons. Also known as a stripped bond or zero coupon bond.",

Forward contract is defined as a customized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. A forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for hedging. Unlike standard futures contracts, a forward contract can be customized to any commodity, amount and delivery date. A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis. Forward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their OTC nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of default risk. As a result, forward contracts are not as easily available to the retail investor as futures contracts. This entity will cover all the forward contract held by the financial institution of their customers.\n\nThe important differences between futures and forwards:\nContract size is decided by the exchange in the case of futures while it is bilateral in the case of forwards.\nPrice of the contract is decided by the market in the case of futures while it is decided by the counterparty in the case of forward\nMargin is required in a futures contract, while it is not mandatory in a forwards contract\nNumber of Contracts is standardized as decided by the exchange, while in a forward contract it is not standardized\nSettlement is by way of cash in a futures contract whereas a forward contract is through delivery of the underlying to the counterparty.",

Investment is defined as a monetary asset purchased with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or appreciate and be sold at a higher price. This entity will cover bonds, MBS, equities etc. where the customer will invest their money with the idea to generate more income in future. This entity will cover products like Government and Municipal Bonds, Covered or Secured Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Fixed Rate and floating rate Bonds, Zero Coupon Bonds, STRIPS and Junk or high yield Bonds.\nMunicipal bond is defined as a debt security issued by a state, municipality or county to finance its capital expenditures. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes and from most state and local taxes, especially if you live in the state in which the bond is issued.\nCovered bond is defined as securities created from public sector loans or mortgage loans where the security is backed by a separate group of loans. Covered bonds typically carry a 2-10 year maturity rate and enjoy relatively high credit ratings, depending on the quality of the pool of loans (cover pool) backing the bond.\nSecured bond is a type of bond that is secured by the issuers pledge of a specific asset, which is a form of collateral on the loan. In the event of a default, the bond issuer passes title of the asset or the money that has been set aside onto the bondholders. Secured bonds can also be secured with a revenue stream that comes from the project that the bond issue was used to finance.\nCorporate bond is a debt security issued by a corporation and sold to investors. The backing for the bond is usually the payment ability of the company, which is typically money to be earned from future operations. In some cases, the companys physical assets may be used as collateral for bonds. Corporate bonds are considered higher risk than government bonds. As a result, interest rates are almost always higher, even for top-flight credit quality companies.\nFixed rate bond is a bond that pays the same amount of interest for its entire term. The benefit of owning a fixed-rate bond is that investors know with certainty how much interest they will earn and for how long. As long as the bond issuer does not default, the bondholder can predict exactly what his return on investment will be.\n Floating rate note is a debt instrument with a variable interest rate. Also known as a floater or FRN, a floating rate notes interest rate is tied to a benchmark such as the U.S. Treasury bill rate, LIBOR, the fed funds or the prime rate. Floaters are mainly issued by financial institutions and governments, and they typically have a two- to five-year term to maturity.\nZero coupon bond is a debt security that does not pay interest (a coupon) but is traded at a deep discount, rendering profit at maturity when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.\nSTRIPS is defined as the process of removing coupons from a bond and then selling the separate parts as a zero coupon bond and interest paying coupons. Also known as a stripped bond or zero coupon bond. \nJunk bond is a colloquial term for a high-yield or non-investment grade bond. Junk bonds are fixed-income instruments that carry a rating of BB or lower by Standard and Poors, or Ba or below by Moody. Junk bonds are so called because of their higher default risk in relation to investment-grade bonds.",

The life of the lease is 75 percent or greater of the assets useful life.\n2. The lease contains a purchase agreement for less than market value.\n3. The lessee gains ownership at the end of the lease period.\n4. The present value of lease payments is greater than 90 percent of the assets market value.\nA capital lease is an example of accrual accountings inclusion of economic events. Generally, companies have a choice of which type of lease they wish to use for accounting purposes, however, both types of leases provide specific advantages and disadvantages to financial statements. For example, companies wishing to show a higher return on asset ratios would choose an operating lease, as the balance sheet would not account for the item as an asset, thus reducing the denominator in the ratio.",

A letter of credit is a document from a bank guaranteeing that a seller will receive payment in full as long as certain delivery conditions have been met. In the event that the buyer is unable to make payment on the purchase, the bank will cover the outstanding amount. They are often used in international transactions to ensure that payment will be received where the buyer and seller may not know each other and are operating in different countries. In this case the seller is exposed to a number of risks such as credit risk, and legal risk caused by the distance, differing laws and difficulty in knowing each party personally. A letter of credit provides the seller with a guarantee that they will get paid as long as certain delivery conditions have been met. For this reason the use of letters of credit has become a very important aspect of international trade. This entity will cover products like Revocable Letter of Credit, Irrevocable Letter of Credit and Transferable Letter of Credit.\nRevocable letter of credit that the granting bank or the letter holder (who is the buyer of some good) may cancel under some or any circumstances. This does not provide the seller with any extra assurance that he or she will be paid on time and in the correct amount. As a result they carry higher risk than irrevocable letters of credit.\nAn irrevocable letter of credit, or ILOC, cannot be canceled or modified in any way without explicit consent by the affected parties involved. For example, the issuing bank has no power to change the terms of an ILOC simply because the letter requester is having second thoughts. It should be noted, however, that ILOCs are in effect only for a specified time period and do, in fact, expire at a pre-determined point.\nTransferable Letter of Credit is a letter of credit that permits the beneficiary of the letter to make some or all of the credit available to another party, thereby creating a secondary beneficiary. The party that initially accepts the transferable letter of credit from the bank is referred to as the first beneficiary. The bank issuing the letter of credit must approve the transfer.",

An overdraft allows the individual to continue withdrawing money even if the account has no funds in it. Basically the financial institution allows people to borrow a set amount of money. This entity will captures all the overdrafts occurred in CASA accounts.\nn overdraft occurs when money is withdrawn from a bank account and the available balance goes below zero. In this situation the account is said to be overdrawn. If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then interest is normally charged at the agreed rate. If the negative balance exceeds the agreed terms, then additional fees may be charged and higher interest rates may apply. Certain retail accounts could provide ATM overdraft where institutions or ATMs may allow cash withdrawals despite insufficient availability of funds. The account holder may or may not be aware of this fact at the time of the withdrawal. If the ATM is unable to communicate with the cardholders bank, it may automatically authorize a withdrawal based on limits preset by the authorizing network. The financial institution charges a fee unexpected to the account holder, creating a negative balance or leaving insufficient funds for a subsequent debit from the same account. The interest rates charged are tiered generally, which means that interest is charged on the entire amount in slabs much like the tax liability. Interest chargeable are capitalized to the account and use the limit allowed on the account.",

The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic interest (coupon) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows against another stream. These streams are called the legs of the swap. The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are accrued and calculated.[1] Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a floating interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity price, or commodity price. This entity will cover all the swaps contracts held by the financial institution of their customers.\n\nThe plain vanilla swap is the interest rate swap where a counterparty exchanges fixed(or floating) interest rate in return for a floating(or fixed) rate (benchmark rate plus spread) on a notional principal primarily as a hedging strategy for a period of time. The other type of swaps are\ncurrency swaps where the exchange of principal on the notional amounts is done at market rates, using the same rate for the transfer at inception as is employed at maturity, there are intermediate interest cash flows that are exchanged between parties. A cross Currency swap is useful to raise capital funding in a foreign market.\n\nThere are different types of swaps contract like accreting swaps, amortizing swaps, basis swap, cross currency swap.",

These are generally short-term with maturities ranging anywhere from a month to a few years. When a term deposit is purchased, the lender (the customer) understands that the money can only be withdrawn after the term has ended or by giving a predetermined number of days notice. Term deposits are an extremely safe investment and are therefore very appealing to conservative, low-risk investors. By having the money tied up you will generally get a higher rate with a term deposit compared with a demand deposit. This entity covers products like regular fixed deposit, recurring deposit, tax saving deposit and certificate of deposits (CD) which are subscribed by financial institutions customers.\nAccount can be owned by multiple individuals, jointly with corporate, government or trust or NGO and   can be transacted through multiple channels like branch, internet, telephone. Financial institutions allow transactions into and out of the account through financial instruments like cheque, bankers cheque, or through electronic payment systems like ACH (Automated Clearing House), RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement). Nomination and guardian facility for minor account is also provided with this product.\nFixed Deposit refers to a savings account or certificate of deposit that pays a fixed rate of interest until a given maturity date. Funds placed in a Fixed Deposit usually cannot be withdrawn prior to maturity or they can perhaps only be withdrawn with advanced notice and or by having a penalty assessed.\nRecurring Deposit is a special kind of Term Deposit offered by banks  which help people with regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their Recurring Deposit account and earn interest at the rate applicable to Fixed Deposits.\nTax saving deposit is a special category of fixed deposits where the investor gets the benefit of a tax break when they invest a sum of money in the deposit. The maximum benefit is available up to an investment of Rs 1 lakh and there is a lock-in period of 5 years in the deposit.\nCertificate of deposit (CD) is a savings certificate entitling the bearer to receive interest. A CD bears a maturity date, a specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination. CDs are generally issued by commercial banks and are insured by the FDIC. The term of a CD generally ranges from one month to five years.",
